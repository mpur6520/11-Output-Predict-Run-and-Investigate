# Output

## Learning Objectives/Goals

Students will learn to interpret, trace, identify and create python code that uses:

|Concept|Explanation|Python Code|Examples|
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
|Output|The computer communicates information to the user.  In this course, we use 'print' to output text to the console.|print("Text goes here")|print("Hello World!")|
|Strings|The text data type. All string data is treated as text, even if it is numerical characters.|"string goes here"| "This is a string"|

## TEACHER NOTES

These activities teach student how to use the 'print' statement to create output.

This is not an entire lesson in itself - it works alongside the other output activities to take students throught the whole PRIMM framework.

## PRIMM Task Predict & Run
At the 'predict' & 'run' stages students work entirely with example code.  They should inspect it carefully and write a prediction about what it will do.

They then run the code and compare the result to their prediction.

## PRIMM Task Investigate

The 'investigate stage gives students some example code and asks them questions about it to check their understanding.  I use the [block model](https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/articles/hw14-the-i-in-primm)  to plan my questions.  Try it, it's really useful.

These activities are fairly self explanatory, however make sure that students have carefully checked their answers to the investigate questions - the 'I love comping' question is designed to prevent students from skim reading the code and build understanding that strings are output **exactly** as they appear in the code, typos and all.

## Misconceptions/Errors to Watch Out For

- print has a capital P
- Missing brackets before/after the string
- Missing speech marks at the beginning/end of text
- Pressing enter inside the string code creates a new line
